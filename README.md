- I know that I should have done the same thing as tf2 game by adding the new content on readme.
- Added a main menu and working on a settings and credits menu.
- Preparing a prototype so that people can playtest.

  01.05.2022 update 2
- Released a really early demo but with assets literally taken from elsewhere.
- Still waiting for my team for the assets and I think that won't be anytime soon and the deadline is close as well.
- The early build can be found on itch.io https://nitrohedge21.itch.io/split-in-reality
- And also on my new repo for the builds! https://github.com/Nitrohedge21/Racoon-Game-Builds
